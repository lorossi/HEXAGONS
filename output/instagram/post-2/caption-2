After a few days I picked up the project again. Encouraged by the prospect of making it work (look mom I almost have 150 followers on Instagram!), I started going through the Mozilla foundation web docs and quickly found many different ways to draw curves.⠀
Of course arcs were not going to make it real (too boring, too regular), so I quickly tried quadratic and Bézier curves. The first solution, once again, was not going to work. The lines connected in a strange way with the sides and I was not able to move around the way I wanted. But with Bézier curves... Boy oh boy.⠀
Look at me, getting all emotional and excited talking about curves! I found out that they worked majestically and I could even add some randomness to each "scene" (set of hexagons) by moving around control points, creating tighter or rounder curves.⠀
I managed to create some "exchanges" between the sides, meaning that each side will be connected to another, randomly picked, side by a Bézier curve. Rotating every hexagon does not break the feeling of a grid and you almost can't tell the difference between one grid and the one generated before it. Another feature that I wanted was that every video has to loop flawlessly. This means that the starting and ending state for each hexagon had to be the same.⠀
How could I do it? By using simplex noise, of course.⠀
