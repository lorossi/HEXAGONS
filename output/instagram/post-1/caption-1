Did you know that you can fill a plane just using hexagons? It's one of the three regular polygons (together with squares and triangles) that have this special feature. John Conway, the legendary British mathematician who also invented Game of Life, called a plane divided into hexagons a hextile.⠀
Having played Civilization V for more than 600 hours, I decided that I wanted to give it a go. Is there a way I could making anything interesting with this kind of concept?⠀
So with this half-plan in mind, I opened up my favourite editor (VScode, I'm too scared to try vim) and then promptly cloned my always-growing, always-improving small canvas boilerplate.⠀
I started playing around with hexagons, moving them, determined to not stop until I had something fully working on my GitHub profile. It took me a good hour just to find a way to place them in a grid. Luckily, there are some good people out there always ready to teach you for free.⠀
Once able to get over this first huge step, it was time to put some creativity in this creative code. First I tried giving different colors to each hexagon, then I started connecting the midpoints of each side and rotating the whole figure. The lines would always connect! I was amazed. Who would have thought that? anybody with half a brain, to be honest.⠀
At that point the path was set, but straight lines were not cutting it. Thing is, there's no easy way to trace a curve using JS on canvas. I looked deeply into Catmull-Rom splines and their relative implementations, but I couldn't really make it work. The lines were way too wonky and not harmonious enough.⠀
So I did what any other reasonable programmer would have done: I quit.⠀
